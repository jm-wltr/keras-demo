# Keras and PyTorch Binary Classification with make_moons & 3D Data

A step-by-step demo of building a binary classifier (logistic regression & simple neural net) in TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch on toy datasets, showcasing some of the most important syntax:

- **2D non-linear “moons”** (make_moons)
- **3D linearly separable** (make_classification)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/keras-demo.git
   cd keras-moons-demo

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies (torch, tensorflow, scikit-learn, matplotlib and numpy)

3. Run the notebooks.
